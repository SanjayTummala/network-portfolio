## 👋 About This Repository

This repository contains my **personal networking-focused portfolio website**.

I built this site to honestly showcase:
- what I’ve **learned**
- what I’ve **built**
- and how I **approach real-world networking problems**

Instead of using generic templates or buzzwords, this portfolio reflects my **hands-on, fundamentals-first learning approach**.

---

## 🧭 My Current Focus

I’m currently preparing for **entry-level networking roles**, building a strong technical foundation before transitioning deeper into **cybersecurity**.

I strongly believe that:
> strong security starts with strong networking fundamentals.

This site represents that phase of my journey.

## 🔧 What This Portfolio Covers

- Enterprise-style network design & simulation  
- Routing and switching fundamentals  
- OSPF dynamic routing (single & multi-area basics)  
- VLAN configuration and Spanning Tree concepts  
- DHCP implementation and IP address management  
- Packet-level analysis (ICMP, ARP, Ping)  
- Structured network troubleshooting  

All projects and labs shown here are based on **hands-on practice**, not copied walkthroughs.

---

## 🧪 Labs & Tools I Use

- **GNS3** – building realistic network simulations  
- **Cisco Packet Tracer** – device & topology practice  
- **Wireshark** – packet capture and protocol analysis  
- **Cisco IOS** – router and switch configuration  
- **Linux** – networking and command-line fundamentals  

---

## 💻 Tech Stack (Website)

- **React + TypeScript**
- **Vite**
- **Framer Motion** (used lightly and intentionally)
- **HTML5 / CSS3**
- Deployed using a modern CDN-based hosting platform

The focus was on **performance, clarity, and readability**, not flashy effects.

## 🧠 Why I Built This

I wanted a portfolio that:
- feels **real**, not exaggerated  
- shows **how I think**, not just what I know  
- grows with me as my skills improve  

This networking portfolio will remain live even after I move into cybersecurity, serving as a reference point for my technical foundation.

---

## 🔮 What’s Next

- More advanced routing & troubleshooting labs  
- Deeper focus on network security fundamentals  
- A separate, dedicated cybersecurity portfolio  
- Clear linking between networking and security work
