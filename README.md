# Sanjay Kumar – Network Engineering Portfolio

This repository contains my personal networking-focused portfolio website, built to showcase my hands-on skills, labs, and projects related to enterprise networking and infrastructure fundamentals.

The goal of this portfolio is to clearly demonstrate **what I can do**, **what I have practiced**, and **how I approach real-world networking problems**, rather than presenting generic or purely academic content.

---

## 🔍 About This Portfolio

I am currently focused on building a strong foundation in **network engineering** before transitioning deeper into **cybersecurity**.  
This website reflects that journey by highlighting:

- Practical networking projects  
- Homelab-style simulations  
- Routing, switching, and troubleshooting experience  
- A methodical, fundamentals-first learning approach  

This portfolio is intentionally **clean, focused, and technical**, designed for recruiters, engineers, and technical reviewers.

## 🧠 Key Focus Areas

- Enterprise-style network design & simulation  
- Routing & switching fundamentals  
- OSPF dynamic routing  
- VLANs and Spanning Tree Protocol  
- DHCP implementation and IP address management  
- Packet analysis (ICMP, ARP, Ping)  
- Network troubleshooting methodology  

---

## 🛠️ Labs & Tools Used

- **GNS3** – Network simulation & homelab environments  
- **Cisco Packet Tracer** – Device & topology practice  
- **Wireshark** – Packet capture and protocol analysis  
- **Cisco IOS** – Router and switch configuration  
- **Linux** – Command-line networking fundamentals

## 🎯 Purpose of This Project

This portfolio serves as:
- A **skills showcase** for entry-level networking roles and internships  
- A **learning log** of hands-on networking practice  
- A **foundation site** that will later link to my cybersecurity-focused portfolio  

The networking site will remain as a reference point even as I transition into security-focused work.
